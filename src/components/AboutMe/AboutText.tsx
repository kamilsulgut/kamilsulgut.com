    "My adventure started with a course organised by CodersLab where I learned the basics and some more advanced programming topics such as JavaScript. Then I started an additional course at the Szko≈Ça reacta (React School). There I learned more about solving complex problems and overcoming challenges by working with React. I continue to refine my path with my mentor, where my current focus points are: React.js, Redux, TypeScript and Next.js.",

I am eager to learn new things and take on challenges. I never give up and always strive to achieve my current goals. I am an open, friendly person with a strong character.",
